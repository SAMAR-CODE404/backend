      dcf_prompt: |
            You are an expert financial analyst performing a **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation** for {company_name}.  
            Retrieve the most relevant financial data from the vector database, including:  
            - Revenue and revenue growth rate  
            - Operating expenses and margins  
            - Free Cash Flow (FCF) for the past 5 years  
            - Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)  
            - Growth rate projections for the next 5 years  
            - Terminal value assumptions (e.g., perpetual growth rate or exit multiple)  

            Ensure that the data is extracted from **the most recent and reliable sources** such as **earnings reports, SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q), investor presentations, and analyst reports**.  

            ### **Step 1: Retrieve and Structure the Data**  
            Format the retrieved data as follows:  
            Company Name: [Extracted Company Name]
            Industry: [Extracted Industry]
            Revenue (last 5 years): [Values]
            Revenue Growth Rate: [Values]
            Operating Expenses: [Values]
            Operating Margins: [Values]
            Free Cash Flow (FCF) (last 5 years): [Values]
            Projected Growth Rate: [Values]
            WACC: [Value]
            Terminal Value Assumption: [Method + Value]

            If certain data points are missing, **approximate them using industry benchmarks** and clearly mention assumptions.  

            ### **Step 2: Perform DCF Valuation**  
            Using the retrieved data, **calculate the intrinsic value of the company using DCF methodology** as follows:  

            1. **Forecast Free Cash Flows (FCF)** for the next 5 years using the retrieved growth rate.  
            2. **Discount future cash flows** to present value using WACC as the discount rate.  
            3. **Calculate the terminal value** using the Gordon Growth Model (`FCF * (1 + g) / (WACC - g)`) or an exit multiple.  
            4. **Sum the present values** of all discounted cash flows and terminal value to estimate the total enterprise value (EV).  
            5. **Adjust for debt and cash** to derive the fair equity value of the company.  

            ### **Step 3: Output the DCF Model Results**  
            Provide a structured output:  

            Projected Free Cash Flow (Next 5 Years): [Values]
            Discount Rate (WACC): [Value]
            Terminal Value: [Value]
            Enterprise Value (EV): [Value]
            Net Debt: [Value]
            Intrinsic Equity Value: [Value]
            Intrinsic Share Price Estimate: [Value]

            If the intrinsic share price deviates significantly from the current market price, provide insights on whether the company appears **undervalued or overvalued** based on the DCF results.  

            ---
            **Note:**
            - **Use the most recent data available** for accurate valuation.
            - **Avoid Hallucination** and ensure all data is supported by reliable sources.
            - **Focus on financial metrics** relevant to DCF analysis.
            - **Provide clear justifications** for any assumptions made in the absence of specific data.

            Dividend Yield: [Value]
