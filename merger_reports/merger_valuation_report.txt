There is not enough information to perform a comprehensive merger valuation analysis. The provided context only mentions "Company B Financial Ratios" and lists various financial ratios without providing any specific data or values. 

To provide a detailed valuation report, more information is needed, such as financial statements, industry benchmarks, and other relevant data. The context does not provide sufficient information to estimate future cash flows, calculate WACC, analyze financial ratios, or assess synergy valuation. 

Therefore, it is not possible to provide a precise valuation range, underlying assumptions, sensitivity analysis, or strategic valuation insights based on the given context.
