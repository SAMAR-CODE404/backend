There is no information provided to perform a comprehensive merger valuation analysis. The context appears to be a jumbled collection of financial terms and phrases, but it lacks any specific data or details about the companies involved in the merger. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a detailed valuation report or calculate key valuation components such as discounted cash flow analysis, comparative valuation methods, synergy valuation, risk-adjusted valuation, or shareholder value analysis.
