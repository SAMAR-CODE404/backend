### Step 2: Perform DCF Valuation

Due to the lack of specific financial data such as revenue, operating expenses, and free cash flow (FCF) for the last 5 years, as well as projected growth rate and WACC, performing a DCF valuation is not feasible with the available information. Therefore, this step cannot be completed.

### Step 3: Financial Ratio Analysis

#### Liquidity Position:
- The current and quick ratios are not available. However, the company successfully managed to navigate a volatile financial environment while maintaining adequate liquidity, which is a positive sign.

#### Profitability Trends:
- The return on equity (ROE) decreased from 10.9% in the previous year to 10.3% in FY 2023-24, attributed to marginally lower profits on weak O2C earnings and higher taxation.

#### Operational Efficiency:
- The net capital turnover ratio improved from 16.97 in FY 2022-23 to 25.43 in FY 2023-24, indicating better efficiency in utilizing capital.
- The inventory turnover ratio decreased to 7.31 in FY 2023-24 from 10.49 in the previous year, primarily due to higher inventories, which may indicate inefficiency in inventory management.

#### Market Valuation:
- Without the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, price-to-book (P/B) ratio, and price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, a detailed market valuation analysis cannot be conducted.

#### Dividend Strategy:
- Information on dividend yield and payout ratio is not available.

#### Overall Financial Health Assessment:
- The company demonstrated resilience in a volatile global financial market environment.
- The return on investment increased from 6.7% in the previous year to 8.5% in FY 2023-24 due to higher yields on the investment portfolio.
- Despite challenging conditions, RIL successfully raised financing across various markets, currencies, and financial products at competitive costs.

### Step 4: Final Investment Recommendation

Given the lack of comprehensive financial data, a detailed DCF valuation, and key financial ratios, a definitive investment recommendation cannot be made. However, the company's ability to navigate a volatile financial environment while maintaining liquidity and delivering consistent returns on its investment portfolio suggests a certain level of financial strength. Investors should consider seeking additional data and analysis before making investment decisions.
