### Step 2: Perform DCF Valuation

Given the lack of specific financial data (revenue, operating expenses, free cash flow), we cannot accurately forecast future cash flows or calculate the terminal value using the Gordon Growth Model. Thus, we cannot estimate the enterprise value, net debt, intrinsic equity value, or intrinsic share price.

### Step 3: Financial Ratio Analysis

- **Liquidity Position**: The company has managed to navigate challenging market conditions while maintaining adequate liquidity. However, the decrease in the inventory turnover ratio suggests potential inefficiencies in managing inventory.
- **Profitability Trends**: The return on equity (ROE) has fallen slightly, indicating a marginal decrease in profitability. The return on investment has increased, suggesting better yields from the investment portfolio.
- **Operational Efficiency**: The improvement in the net capital turnover ratio suggests better efficiency in using capital. However, the decrease in inventory turnover ratio is a concern.
- **Market Valuation**: Without specific ratios like P/E, P/B, and P/S, it's challenging to assess the market valuation.
- **Dividend Strategy**: Not enough information is provided to assess the dividend strategy.
- **Overall Financial Health Assessment**: The company seems to be managing its financials effectively amidst challenging market conditions, with some areas of concern regarding inventory management and profitability.

### Step 4: Final Investment Recommendation

Given the limited financial data available, it's challenging to make a definitive investment recommendation. However, based on the information provided, Reliance Industries Limited appears to be navigating market challenges effectively and has shown improvements in certain financial metrics. Without a comprehensive DCF valuation and financial ratio analysis, any investment decision would be speculative.

- **Investment Decision**: Hold, pending further analysis with more detailed financial data.
- **Supporting Insights**: The company's ability to raise financing across various markets and its diverse business segments are strengths. However, the decrease in inventory turnover and slight fall in ROE are areas of concern that need monitoring. A more detailed analysis with complete financial data is necessary for a definitive recommendation.
