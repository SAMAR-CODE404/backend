### Step: Perform DCF Valuation
Due to the lack of necessary data (revenue, operating expenses, operating margins, free cash flow, projected growth rate, WACC, and terminal value assumption), a DCF valuation cannot be accurately performed.

### Step: Financial Ratio Analysis
Given the limited availability of financial ratios, a comprehensive analysis is not possible. However:
- **Return on Equity (ROE)** has decreased to 10.3% in FY 2023-24 from 10.9% in the previous year, indicating a slight decline in profitability.
- **Inventory Turnover Ratio** decreased to 7.31 in FY 2023-24 from 10.49 in the previous year, suggesting less efficient inventory management.

### Step: Final Investment Recommendation
Without comprehensive financial data and analysis, it's challenging to make an informed investment decision. The decrease in ROE and inventory turnover ratio may indicate some challenges, but these are not sufficient to base a recommendation on.
